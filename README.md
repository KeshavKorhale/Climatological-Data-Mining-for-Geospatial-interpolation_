# Information  about  raw data

All the details about climate data
This project is focuses on the mean of 30 years (1971-2000) monthly data of 417 observatory stations distributed all over the country.
The raw data contained the following information for 417 weather stations â€“
Station Name, Station index no., Date of establishment of observatory station, Latitude,Longitude
Location and environment of the observatory station
The given climatological data consist of nearly 50 columns with means over 30 years for each month with each different parameter.
Raw data  consist  of :
  Station level Pressure in hPa
  Dry Bulb Temperature (DBT) in degree Celsius
  Wet Bulb Temperature (WBT) in degree Celsius 
  Daily Max and Daily Min temperature in degree Celsius
  Extremes temperatures in degree Celsius
  Relative Humidity in percentage (%)
  Vapour Pressure in hpa
  Cloud Amounts in okta (s) of sky
  Monthly Total Rainfall in mm
  Mean Wind Speed in Kmph
  No of days with visibility
  Number of days with Weather phenomena such as hail, thunder, fog, dust storm, squall .
